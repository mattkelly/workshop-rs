# Mocking

Mocking is a way of isolating code under test by replacing dependencies with
implementations that emulate real functionality.

This is quite useful when dependencies are difficult to incorporate into a unit
testing framework.

There are _many_ Rust crates that provide mocking currently with no clear
community preference yet.

You can read more about the different mocking frameworks here:
