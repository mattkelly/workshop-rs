# Introduction

Rust's type system helps us enormously with program correctness.

We can't make type confusion errors like in C.

The type system cannot prevent all bugs however. Our program can suffer
from a logical mistake for instance.

To prevent these issues in practice, Rust has a builtin unit and integration
testing framework to make it easy for you test your code in practice.
