# Introducing `criterion.rs` [![Latest Version]][crates.io]

If we're looking to run benchmark test using the stable compiler, we might want
to consider using a statistical based benchmarking framework like
`criterion.rs`.

> Criterion.rs helps you write fast code by detecting and measuring performance
> improvements or regressions, even small ones, quickly and accurately. You can
> optimize with confidence, knowing how each change affects the performance of
> your code.
