# Benchmark Testing

Cargo supports another testing based command called `cargo bench`.

Unfortunately, the default bench testing framework Cargo use is only available
on nightly compiler.

A bench test in Rust looks something like this:

```rust,ignore
#![feature(test)]

extern crate test;

pub fn add_two(a: i32) -> i32 {
    a + 2
}

#[cfg(test)]
mod tests {
    use super::*;
    use test::Bencher;

    #[test]
    fn it_works() {
        assert_eq!(4, add_two(2));
    }

    #[bench]
    fn bench_add_two(b: &mut Bencher) {
        b.iter(|| add_two(2));
    }
}
```
