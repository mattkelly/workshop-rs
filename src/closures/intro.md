# Introduction

Rust is significantly influenced by _functional programming_.

Specifically, _function programming_ influences in Rust includes passing
functions as arguments, returning functions from other functions and assigning
functions to variables.

We're going to discuss two major topics:

- _Closures_: a function-like construct you can store in a variable
- _Iterators_: a way of processing a series of elements
