# Recap

In the last three talks, we've introduced several topics related to generics:

- __Generic type parameters__ for removing duplication
- __Traits__ for defining shared behavior
- __Trait bounds__ for enhancing generic type parameters with behaviors
- __Generic lifetime parameters__ for eliminating dangling references

There's much more to learn on all of these topics, stay tuned!
